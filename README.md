# bitcoinbot
Super basic bot for playing around with bitcoin trading strategies.

## Getting Started

Run `npm install`

To run the bot against live bitcoin prices run `npm start live`

While running, the bot will update bitcoin prices every 5 seconds and store them in array2.csv

To run the bot against historical prices (located in array.csv) run `npm start`

Note: this is a very small and old set of prices, I'd recommend running the bot live for a day or two to get your own historical bitcoin prices or finding a better source.
